# Hebrew translation tools

Python 3 tools for translating Heart & Soul into Hebrew and checking the result. They need Python
3.9 or newer: the tool tests pass on 3.9.6, 3.11.9 and 3.14.7, and every script compiles with
warnings as errors on those three; the other scripts have only been run on 3.11.9. They use only
the standard library, except the ones that draw pictures, which need Pillow: `fontcells.py`, the font scripts in `fonts/`
that draw, everything in `graphics/` and the review-sheet scripts in `emu/scripts/`. `inventory/`
needs numpy. The tools that read an ELF (`rom_sweep.py`, the harness
in `emu/`, `inventory/`) need devkitARM (`DEVKITARM`, default `/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM`). Every
tool runs from any working directory. The style guide and glossary are in `translation/hebrew/`.

## Locations

`paths.py` resolves every location. You can override each one with an environment variable.
`python3 tools/hebrew/paths.py` prints the values in use.

| Variable | What | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HNS_TREE` | Hebrew source tree | this repository |
| `HNS_BASELINE` | engine baseline: the Hebrew engine with English strings (drift and chunk source) | `../pokehns-heb-engine`, if it exists |
| `HNS_UPSTREAM` | upstream English tree | `../pokehns-en`, if it exists |
| `HNS_FIRERED` | the FireRed Hebrew tree, for `namecheck.py --fr-sync` | `../pokefirered-heb`, if it exists |
| `HNS_FONTS_TREE` | tree whose `src/fonts.c` and `charmap.txt` set the glyph widths | `HNS_TREE` |
| `HNS_DATA` | data the tools read | `tools/hebrew/data` |
| `HNS_GLOSSARY` | glossary (`glossary_sources.csv` sits next to it) | `translation/hebrew/glossary.csv` |
| `HNS_WORK` | scratch and output folder | `build/hebrew` |
| `HNS_UNITS` | translation unit chunks | `$HNS_WORK/units` |
| `HNS_ROM`, `HNS_EN_ROM` | Hebrew and English ROMs (each `.elf` sits next to its ROM) | `$HNS_TREE/pokehns.gba`, `$HNS_UPSTREAM/pokehns.gba` |
| `HNS_SAVES` | the saves a tour starts from (`start saves/NAME` is read as `$HNS_SAVES/NAME`): the save ladder (`ladder1_newgame.sav` ... `ladder6_postgame.sav`) and the tour base saves (`menuA_base.sav`, `pif2_base.sav`, `r1field_menuA_base.sav` and others), all at the top of the private builds repository's `saves/`; a round tour (`emu/tours/<round>/`) whose save is only in a subfolder needs `HNS_SAVES` set to that subfolder | none: the saves are not in the repository |
| `HNS_RUNNER` | the `hnsrun` binary | `tools/hebrew/emu/hnsrun` |

## Workflow

1. **Extract.** `units.py extract FILE...` prints the player-visible strings of the given files
   as JSON units. `units.py status FILE...` counts how many of them are already in Hebrew.
2. **Chunk.** `make_chunks.py B10 [B20 ...|all] [--out DIR]` cuts each named inventory batch
   (`data/inventory.json`) into chunk files in `$HNS_UNITS/<batch>/` (or `DIR/<batch>/`). It extracts the units from
   `HNS_BASELINE` and fills in names from the glossary. The sweep reads every file there, so each
   run first removes the named batches' chunk files of an earlier run (`<batch>_NN.json`,
   `_names.json`, `_sNN.json`, `_snames.json`; no other file) and prints any it did not write
   again; with `all` it also warns about a folder of a batch the inventory no longer has.
   `--supplement` removes nothing, but every supplement run numbers its files from `_s01`, so a
   second one writes over the first one's files of the same names (`_s01.json`, `_snames.json`).
3. **Translate.** Fill each unit's `"he"` by following `translation/hebrew/STYLE.md` and the
   glossary. `merge_he.py CHUNK.json TRANSLATIONS.json` merges an `{id: hebrew}` file into a chunk.
4. **Check.** `checkunits.py CHUNK.json...` checks tokens, terminators, escapes, the charset,
   digits, leftover Latin, width and lines. `wrap.py TEXT` re-wraps a string to its budget.
   `textwidth.py TEXT` measures a string.
5. **Apply.** `units.py apply CHUNK.json... [--dry-run]` writes the Hebrew into `HNS_TREE`.
   It refuses a string that changed since the chunk was made, and a string that already holds
   different Hebrew (an old chunk would undo a later fix) unless `--overwrite-hebrew` is given.
   `apply_names.py` writes trainer and map-section names. Run `gen_dex_alpha.py` after the species
   names change, and `gen_ec_order.py` and `gen_ec_letters.py` after an Easy Chat word, species or
   move name changes.
6. **Drift.** `drift.py FILE...` checks that a translated file differs from `HNS_BASELINE` only
   inside its strings.
7. **Audit.** `audit.py [PATH...] [--baseline "$HNS_UPSTREAM"]` runs a static layout audit of
   every string. It skips the headers `make` generates from the `.party` files and the region-map
   JSON, whose strings it reads from those sources, so a built tree and a clean checkout give the
   same report. For the glossary, `namecheck.py --all` checks bytes, the charset, final letters
   and duplicates; `--warnings` adds three consistency checks that only warn (`--fr-sync`: a name
   that differs from the FireRed translation's current one; `--translit`: a transliteration slip;
   `--dupes`: one English person name with two Hebrew spellings), with the explained cases in
   `data/namecheck_allow.json`. `glossary_widths.py` reports names wider than their budget.
   `plurals.py` checks that every item a player can hold more than one of has a Hebrew plural
   (an `item_plural` row, and its `pluralName` in `src/data/items.h` when it differs).
8. **Build.** `make hns`, or `make hns RTL_CLIP_REPORT=1` for the clip-report build
   (`pokehns-clip.gba`).
9. **Harness.** `rom_sweep.py` lists English text left in the built ROM. The screen tours, the
   label sweep and the map walk run in the headless emulator (`emu/README.md`). `cliptour.py`
   decodes the clip log, and `pairsheets.py` makes side-by-side screenshot sheets.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `apply_names.py` | writes glossary names into the `.party` files and `region_map_sections.json` |
| `audit.py` | static width/lines/buffer/bytes/charset audit of every player-visible string |
| `check_chunked.py` | runs the `make check` suite one test-name prefix per chunk, as CI does (`data/crashing_tests.txt` runs alone) |
| `check_tests.py` | compares a `make check` log with the tests upstream already fails (`data/known_test_failures.txt`) |
| `checkunits.py` | validates translated chunks before they are applied |
| `cliptour.py` | reads the RTL clip log of a clip build between harness steps (`hns.py tour --clip`) |
| `drift.py` | checks that a translated file changed only inside its strings |
| `flag_gates.py` | takes match calls, TV shows and PokéNews behind flags defined as 0, and labels that are not built (`--elf`), out of the live list of `data/live_labels.json`; `--check` exits 1 when the file is stale (CI) |
| `fontcells.py` | shows, per Latin font, whether each glyph cell is blank and how wide it is (`fontcells.py TREE [HEX...]`) |
| `gen_dex_alpha.py` | regenerates the Hebrew alphabetical Pokédex order from the glossary; `--check` exits 1 when the header is stale (CI) |
| `gen_ec_order.py` | regenerates the Hebrew order of the Easy Chat group lists (`src/data/easy_chat/easy_chat_order_rtl.h`) from the word texts; `--check` exits 1 when it is stale (CI, and `tests/test_easy_chat.py`) |
| `gen_ec_letters.py` | regenerates the Easy Chat ABC keyboard's lists by Hebrew letter (`src/data/easy_chat/easy_chat_words_by_letter_rtl.h`) from the word, species and move texts; `--check` exits 1 when it is stale (CI). The header holds only word constants and is picked onto `he/renderer` with the engine |
| `glossary_widths.py` | glossary names wider than their screen budget and than the English name |
| `make_chunks.py` | cuts inventory batches into translation chunks |
| `merge_he.py` | merges `{id: hebrew}` translations into a chunk |
| `namecheck.py` | validates glossary rows: bytes, charset, final letters, duplicates; `--warnings` (or `--fr-sync`, `--translit`, `--dupes`) warns on names that differ from FireRed's, transliteration slips and two-way person names, minus `data/namecheck_allow.json` |
| `pairsheets.py` | side-by-side review sheets of two screenshot runs |
| `paths.py` | the locations above |
| `plurals.py` | every stackable item has a Hebrew plural row that `src/data/items.h` prints (DECISIONS.md Q125) |
| `rom_sweep.py` | finds English strings that are still in a built Hebrew ROM |
| `status_report.py` | writes `translation/hebrew/STATUS.md` (`--sweep SWEEP.json` marks what the dialogue sweep rendered) |
| `strcov.py` | string coverage: maps the logs of the string-report build (`make hns RTL_STRING_REPORT=1`) to the translated C strings and lists the ones no tour has shown |
| `strchars.py` | counts the non-ASCII characters and `{TOKENS}` used in string literals (`[TREE]`, default `HNS_TREE`) |
| `textwidth.py` | pixel width model of the RTL renderer (CLI and library) |
| `translit_stats.py` | statistics on FireRed transliteration choices, for `transliteration_rules.md` |
| `units.py` | extracts strings into units and writes translations back |
| `wrap.py` | wraps a Hebrew string to a kind's pixel budget |

`fonts/` holds the Hebrew glyph designs and the installer that writes them into the nine fonts,
`graphics/` the scripts that drew the Hebrew labels in `graphics/`, and `inventory/` the builder
of `live_labels.json`, `inventory.json` and `c_strings.json`; each has a README. The font
installer's checks need only the standard library, but `graphics/` and the font previews need
Pillow, and `inventory/` needs numpy and devkitARM.

`release/` builds a release candidate, runs every harness test on the files that ship and writes
`TESTING.md` (`release/README.md`; the screenshot review is in `release/REVIEW.md`). `testmsgs/`
rebuilds the battle tests' Hebrew message table (`testmsgs/README.md`).

`emu/` holds the headless mGBA harness (see `emu/README.md`). `data/` holds what the tools read
at run time: `budgets.json` (pixel budgets per string kind), `live_labels.json` and
`c_strings.json` (which script labels and C literals the H&S build uses), `inventory.json` (files
and batches), `namecheck_allow.json` (the name differences kept on purpose, each with its reason)
and `font_drafts/` (draft Hebrew widths for `--hebrew-widths draft`).

Tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/hebrew/tests` (NTESTS tests in NFILES files). The test for
the English ROM runs only when `HNS_EN_ROM` exists, the `KEPT_LATIN` test only with the English tree
(`HNS_UPSTREAM`), the runner's PC-region test only with a C compiler (`cc`), one test needs the
built `tools/preproc`, one needs the English tree's `Makefile`, and two need devkitARM's
`arm-none-eabi-gcc`.
